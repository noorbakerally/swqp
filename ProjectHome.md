The Semantic Water Quality Portal is a system developed to bridge data coming from national research bodies including United States Geological Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as state environmental agencies. These data are merged and used to classify polluted water sources using an OWL 2 ontology to help citizens better understand issues of water quality in their communities.
